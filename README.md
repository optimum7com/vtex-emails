## Folders and structure

- `public` compiled files for preview
- `dist` compiled files for exporting
- `source` working folder
  - `data` JSON files containing Orders data
  - `helpers` VTEX's Helpers functions
  - `locales` i18n files
  - `sass` styles
  - `templates` e-mails templates
    - `partials` e-mails parts

### You must NOT add, change or modify:

- `helpers` you can use only Handlebars and VTEX's Helpers

### You can add, change or modify:

- `data` you can create folders with different JSON examples as well. They must have a real VTEX JSON structure
- `locales` use your own communication
- `sass` use your own style
- `templates` name your templates your own way. **Each template must have a JSON file with the same name.**
- `partials` use the partials that make sense for you

## Hands on

### Installation

1.  Download or clone VTEX Emails
2.  Install npm dependencies: run `npm install`

### Developing

1.  Run `npm run gulp dev`
2.  Go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
3.  Choose the language folder and open the template that you want to preview

### Generating an exportable VTEX template

1.  Run `npm run gulp dist`
2.  Go to `dist` folder, copy the template content and paste it in VTEX Message Center

### Generating a light preview version for testing

1.  Run `npm run gulp preview`
2.  Go to `public` folder, copy the template content and test it using services like MailChimp

### Changing JSON data set

1.  Stop npm service
2.  Create a new folder in `source/data`
3.  Change `orderJsonToRead` variable in `gulpfile.js` to the new folder name
4.  Start npm service

## To do

- Live reload is not working very well. Sometimes you need to refresh the page manually
- Recompiling doesn't work for JSON changes. You'll need to stop npm service and start it again
- Improve Outlook compatibility
- Improve VTEX inStore scenarios
